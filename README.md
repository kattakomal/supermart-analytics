# Supermart Analytics

# Introduction: 
In this project we are going to collect, clean and analyze data for the Supermart sales to predict the future sales trends and know past analysis trends based on the sales of the products during a period of some years.

# Objective:
To build an end-to-end platform that Ingests and processes data (structured and unstructured), Generates machine learning insights, NLP-based summaries, and predictive analytics, visualizes those insights through interactive dashboards and generates exportable reports.

# Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python 

Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, ReportLab  

Visualization Tools: Jupiter Notebook, D3.js, Streamlit 

# Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:
For Data ingestion, the data is collected from the sales done for the period from 2015 to 2019. 

And preprocessed the data using the python for data cleaning by loading the raw data in the jupyter notebook.

And the cleaned data set as shown below:

# EDA: 
Here we have done the exploratory analysis of the using the boxplot for Sales vs. Catogery and Sales trend over time as shown in the below images.

# ML Model and Predictive Analysis:
Here the data is split into train and test to predict the sales analysis for the future trends of the sales data by creating a machine learning model using the train and split method. And calculating the regression model mean square error for the Linear Regression and Random Forest as shown in the below image.

And created the plots like this below images.

# Data Visualizations: 

Here we created the visualizations about the Sales Forecast and ML Model Performance (RMSE) using D3.js by creating a single page app as shown in the below image.

And we also done the visualizations using the Streamlit app as shown in the below image.

# Summary & (PDF) Report: 

Here we get the summary of the dataset by using the excel to create the summary sheet as shown below.

And, by using the Report Lab library from python a PDF report of the sales summary of total sales and dashboards of the visualizations as shown in the below image.
